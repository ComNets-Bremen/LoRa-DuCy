# LoRa-DuCy

This repository contains the code related to the implementation of the Contiki MAC radio duty cycle protocol on LoRa, performed on PyCom devices (Firmware 1.18.3). Upload the main.py and boot.py files to the LoPy4 device. Main.py file contains the Contiki MAC implementation and the code is commented for easy understanding. All the Contiki MAC parameters are included into the main.py and parameters can be changed. However, it is important to make sure while changing paramters that all the parameter values must satisfy the Contiki MAC timing conditions.
